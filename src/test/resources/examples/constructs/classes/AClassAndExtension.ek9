  <?-
    Just put this in to test out the override key word on methods
    When the method does not override anything compiler should pick up when used incorrectly.
    Also we method does override method from super or trait compiler should pick up and error if you don't use override
    Finally for private methods where override is used the compiler errors because that makes no sense.
    
    Also now using abstract makes a class open to extend, but also if you have a concrete class and you want to allow
    extension then you must explicitly allow it by using 'open'. So by default a concrete class is 'final' by default
    i.e not open to be extended.
    
    Moved the open to be like abstract in its position, so make the definition more readable - you can use extends or is
    'defines class Extensions extends Base as open'
    So anything that s defined abstract is automatically open, but a class that can be instantiated is automatically
    closed (ie cannot be extended) unless it is stated as being 'open' for extension.
    
    Note I'm also trying out assignment with just = rather than :=, but you can also just use : which looks and feels
    quite nice in some locations.
