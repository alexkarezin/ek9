defines module lists.and.dictionaries

  <?-
    A demonstration of lists and dictionaries.
    How they can be written in a fairly free format.
    Also how named values on parameters can be employed so that the
    use of the parameters is a lot easy to understand as first look.

    function1()
      ->
        focus as Integer
        name as String
        values as Dict of (Integer, String)
      <-
        rtn as Float: 0.0

      result <- function1(1, "Steve", {1: "quick", 2: "brown", 3: "fox"})

      Use of named parameters makes this code a bit more verbose,
      but much more obvious.
