<?-
  This is not relating to the definition of Generic/Template classes and Functions.
  But just their use, i.e. assuming that some generic type exists creating instances of those
  with a range of (built in) types to ensure they can be parsed but also created and then subsequently resolved.

  This example is only designed to check the 'definition phase' where types are explicitly declared.
  For example List of String, bit not designed to check for List("Steve").
