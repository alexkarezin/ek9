<?-
  Demonstrates the error of trying to use a know class that resolves as a generic
  type. i.e. 'List of String' is fine but 'Date of String' is meaningless as Date is
  not a generic type, it does not support Polymorphic Parameterization.
  Also examples of non generic functions being attempted to be used.
