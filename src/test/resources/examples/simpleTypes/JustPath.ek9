  <!-
    Introduced the concept of a path, but more than just a string.

    This will be checked by the compiler when it is a literal.
    The idea is much like jsonPath (xmlPath), initially just name and array use.
    But in the fullness of time maybe built in expressions and predicates.

    The path starts with $?

      propertyFromFirstElement <- $?[0].a-field

      //Not to be confused with string conversion
